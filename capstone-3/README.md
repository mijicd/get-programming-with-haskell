# Working with time series

The chapter illustrates the common techniques for handling time-series data.
It covers the following functional programming principles:

- creating custom types
- using `Maybe` to model missing values
- combining sets of values using `Map`
- using `Semigroup` and `Monoid` type classes to combine custom types
